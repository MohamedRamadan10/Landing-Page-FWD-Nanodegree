## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of
the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS
files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
Udacity Classroom.


## ES6

I used several ES6 methods and also Javascript and browser functions which are
only available in the latest modern browsers, e.g.

Most of the changes have happened in the `js/app.js` file and some changes for
styling in `styles.css`

## Done

This project has been enhanced with dynamic generated Navigation list (based on
the sections) in an unordered list as well as scrolling to the section.
